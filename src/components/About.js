      Real Estate was founded in 1996 when co workers Lars Bj√∂rnsson reached out
      to Guy Adams, the two of them met while working at a large real estate
      firm. but both had get tired of the stress in the workplace and that it
      was all about sales.
      <p /> They wanted to shift the focus to the most important aspect in Real
      Estate, the client, and that is you!
